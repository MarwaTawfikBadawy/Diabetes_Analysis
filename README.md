## Metabolome-based profiling of African baobab fruit (Adansonia digitata L.) using a multiplex approach of MS and NMR techniques in relation to its biological activity

Adansonia digitata L. also known as African baobab is one of the most important fruit-producing trees,
widely distributed in the African continent. Baobab fruits are known to possess potential health benefits
and nutritional value. This study aimed to holistically dissect the metabolome of A. digitata fruits using
a novel comparative protocol using three different analytical platforms. Ultra high performance liquid
chromatography coupled to high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-HRMS/MS), and
headspace solid-phase microextraction/gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (HS-SPME/
GC-MS) were respectively employed for phytonutrients and aroma profiling, whereas GC-MS post
silylation provided an overview of nutrients i.e., sugars. UHPLC-HRMS/MS analysis allowed for the
assignment of 77 metabolites, among which 50% are reported for the first time in the fruit. While GC-MS
of silylated and aroma compounds led to the identification of 74 and 16 compounds, respectively.
Finally, NMR-based metabolite fingerprinting permitted the quantification of the major metabolites for
future standardization. In parallel, in vivo antidiabetic potential of the baobab fruit using a streptozotocin
(STZ) induced diabetic rat model was assessed. Histopathological and immune-histochemical
investigations revealed hepatoprotective and renoprotective effects of A. digitata fruit along with
mitigation against diabetes complications. Moreover, the administration of A. digitata fruits (150 mg kg-1)
twice a week lowered fasting blood glucose levels.
